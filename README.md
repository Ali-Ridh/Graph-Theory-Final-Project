## A. Introduction

Informatics students often face a stereotype where they're seen as introverts who stick to their circles, rarely venturing outside their social community. This misconception can lead to a lack of social interaction and missed opportunities for collaboration even within their own department relatives. To help solve previous problems, we proposed a solution in the form of a friend matching app named “Informatch”.
Informatch’s main purpose is to act as a social media reference for the Students to help foster a sense of community among students by encouraging social connections, breaking down social barriers, and promoting a more engaging social culture within the department. Informatch works by giving the user a friend recommendation through its matching system based on their preferences, whether it’s for educational purposes, sport and lifestyle, entertainment, and many more. 
By using Informatch, students can expand their social networks beyond their usual circles. Informatch’s personalized recommendation system ensures that users are matched based on shared interests and compatible personalities. This would make interactions more meaningful and enjoyable.
